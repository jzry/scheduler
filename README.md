# CPU Scheduling

## The CPU Scheduler
- The processor selects a process from the ready queue to run
- Scheduler runs when a running process halts to let the next process run
- Dispatcher is part of the CPU scheduler that actually does the context switching from one process to another once the new process is selected
- Scheduling is the process of assigning processor resources to complete tasks, or processes
- Preemptive algorithms work more effectively for multitasking systems because they have a built in interrupt which prevents starvation in CPU schedulers, so every process has an equal chance to execute until termination.

## Scheduling criteria
- Scheduling algorithms are trying to achieve the best:
- **CPU Utilization** - Keep the CPU as busy as possible so to avoid wasting hardware time
- **Throughput** - The number of processes completed per time unit
- **Turnaround time** - For a given process, how long it takes to execute that process from start to finish
- **Waiting time** - The amount of time a process is reading without running
- **Response time** - The time between when a user submits a request and the first output to that user

## Scheduling Algorithms
- **First come first served**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive. Not the most efficient way to schedule tasks because certain tasks may run forever. 
- **Preemptive Shortest Job First**: 
- **Round-Robin**: The scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process, called a time *quantum*. If one process completes within that process it gets terminated, but if it doesn't, it gets rescheduled to the back of the queue.

## First Come, First Serve
Processes are allocated to the CPU and executed in the CPU in the order in which they arrive.

## Shortest Job First
Processes are allocated to the CPU in the order of the processes that have the shortest burst. Can be cooperative or preemptive

## Round-Robin
Uses a time interrupt using a preset time quantum to stop a process


## Example Input

```
processcount 2        # Read 5 processes
runfor 15             # Run for 15 time units
use rr                # Can be fcfs, sjf, or rr
quantum 2             # Time quantum â€“ only if using rr
process name P1 arrival 3 burst 5
process name P2 arrival 0 burst 9
end
```

## Example Output

```
2 processes
Using Round-Robin
Quantum 2
Time 0: P2 arrived
Time 0: P2 selected (burst 9)
Time 2: P2 selected (burst 7)
Time 3: P1 arrived
Time 4: P1 selected (burst 5)
Time 6: P2 selected (burst 5)
Time 8: P1 selected (burst 3)
Time 10: P2 selected (burst 3)
Time 12: P1 selected (burst 1)
Time 13: P1 finished
Time 13: P2 selected (burst 1)
Time 14: P2 finished
Time 14: Idle
Finished at time 15

P1 wait 5 turnaround 10
P2 wait 5 turnaround 14
```

## Parsing input
Scheduler uses a series of decision statements to catch keywords from input file.

### Keywords
- processcount
    + catch number
- runfor
    + catch number
- use
    + catch process (fcfs, sjf, rr)
- quantum
    + catch time
- process
    + catch name
        + catch arrival
            + catch burst
- end
    + break
